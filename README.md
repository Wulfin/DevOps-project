### Notes

- DNS works by having a domain, changing dns servers of that domain to own dns servers
- venv make it better to work using python cause it protects from dependencies and versions conflicts as everything is just installed in the virtual env
- We can structure an ansible role to 3: tasks where we put the plays to be executed, files where we put the files that we'll need in the role and handlers for special steps to execute where a certain condition is verified
